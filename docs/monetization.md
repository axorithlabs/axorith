# Our Monetization Philosophy

We believe in transparency. This document explains why Axorith uses the Business Source License (BSL), how we plan to build a sustainable project, and what that means for our users and contributors.

Our goal is to create a powerful, community-driven ecosystem that can support itself and its core developers long-term, while ultimately becoming a true open-source asset.

## Why Business Source License (BSL) 1.1?

The BSL is a "Source Available" license that strikes a balance between open-source ideals and the reality of building a business as an independent developer. It allows us to invest heavily in Axorith without the risk of a large corporation simply taking our work and offering it as a competing paid service.

The most important part of our BSL is the **Change Date**. On that date, the license for this code will automatically convert to a fully compliant, permissive open-source license (Apache 2.0). This is our promise to the community: we are building a business *on top of* an open-source core, not creating a closed, proprietary product.

## Our Business Model: Freemium & Open Core

We are building Axorith on a Freemium model. The core experience is free and powerful, with an optional paid tier for professionals and teams who need to take their productivity to the next level.

### Axorith Free

The free version of Axorith is a complete, powerful tool for individual use. It will **never** have artificial limitations on core features like the number of presets you can create.

*   **Unlimited** local presets.
*   Access to all **basic official modules** (App/Site Blockers, System Focus, etc.).
*   Ability to install and use **all community-created modules**.

Our goal is to make the free version the best tool in its class for personal productivity.

### Axorith Pro

**Axorith Pro** is a paid subscription that unlocks a comprehensive suite of advanced features and modules designed for professionals, power users, and teams. This is how we fund the project's development.

The Pro tier is a single bundle that includes:
*   ✅ **Access to all Pro Modules:** Unlock powerful, officially supported integrations with tools like Spotify, Slack, Jira, VS Code, and more.
*   ✅ **Axorith for Teams:** Create and share presets across your entire team, with centralized management and billing.
*   ✅ **Advanced Core Features:** Get access to powerful tools like the Session Scheduler and in-depth Focus Analytics.
*   ✅ **Cloud Sync:** Securely synchronize your presets across all your devices.
*   ✅ **Priority Support:** Get faster help and support directly from the development team.

This model allows us to offer a robust free tool to the entire community, while charging for advanced functionality that professionals and businesses need to excel.

## What This Means for Contributors

We are incredibly grateful for every contribution. By contributing, you are helping build a powerful tool that will eventually become a true open-source project for everyone.

Community-created modules can be offered for free to all users. In the future, we plan to launch a marketplace where developers can also offer their own paid modules.

We are committed to building this project in the open, with and for our community. Thank you for your trust and support.
