# Our Monetization Philosophy

We believe in transparency. This document explains why Axorith uses the Business Source License (BSL), how we plan to build a sustainable project, and what that means for our users and contributors.

Our goal is to create a powerful, community-driven ecosystem that can support itself and its core developers long-term, while ultimately becoming a true open-source asset.

## Why Business Source License (BSL) 1.1?

The BSL is a "Source Available" license that strikes a balance between open-source ideals and the reality of building a business as an independent developer. It allows us to invest heavily in Axorith without the risk of a large corporation simply taking our work and offering it as a competing paid service.

The most important part of our BSL is the **Change Date**. On that date, the license for this code will automatically convert to a fully compliant, permissive open-source license (Apache 2.0). This is our promise to the community: we are building a business *on top of* an open-source core, not creating a closed, proprietary product.

## Our Business Model

We are building Axorith on a Freemium model designed to give everyone access to the full power of the platform, while charging for scale, convenience, and enterprise infrastructure.

### 1. Axorith Free

The free version of Axorith is a complete, powerful tool for personal productivity. Unlike many other tools, **we do not gate modules behind a paywall.** You get access to every integration we build.

*   ✅ **Access to ALL Modules:** Use every official module (Spotify, Home Assistant, VS Code, Site Blockers, etc.) and all community modules without restriction.
*   ✅ **Core Engine:** Full access to the local session engine.
*   ⚠️ **Limit:** **Maximum of 3 Session Presets.**

Our goal is to let you experience the full capability of Axorith for your most critical workflows (e.g., "Deep Work", "Meeting Mode", "Gaming") completely free.

### 2. Axorith Pro

**Axorith Pro** is for power users who want to automate every aspect of their life and need seamless synchronization.

*   ✅ **Unlimited Presets:** Create as many specific workflows as you need.
*   ✅ **Cloud Sync:** Securely synchronize your presets and settings across all your devices.
*   ✅ **Session Scheduler:** Automate your focus. Schedule sessions to start automatically at specific times or recurring intervals.
*   ✅ **Priority Support:** Get faster help directly from the development team.

### 3. Axorith for Teams

**Axorith for Teams** is designed for organizations and power users who need advanced infrastructure control and collaboration features.

*   ✅ **Remote Host Deployment:** The ability to deploy `Axorith.Host` on a remote server or cloud instance, allowing you to control a dedicated workspace or build server remotely from your client.
*   ✅ **Preset Sharing:** Create standard operating procedures (SOPs) as presets and share them instantly with your team.
*   ✅ **Focus Analytics:** Detailed insights into team productivity and session usage.
*   ✅ **Centralized Management:** Unified billing and user management.
