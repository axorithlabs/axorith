## The Problem: The "Focus Tax"

Every time you start a task, you pay a tax in time and willpower. This 15-minute setup ritual is a barrier to entry. It's friction.


| The Old Way (Manual Setup)            | The Axorith Way (Automated Flow)        |
|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| 😩 Hunt for apps & project files.     | ✅ **Apps launch instantly.**            |
| 🎵 Find the right focus playlist.     | ✅ **Music starts automatically.**       |
| 🔇 Silence a storm of notifications.  | ✅ **Distractions are muted.**           |
| 🛡️ Manually enable website blockers. | ✅ **Focus shield is engaged.**          |
| 🖥️ Arrange windows across monitors.  | ✅ **Workspace is ready.**               |
| **15 minutes of friction.**           | **Less than 15 seconds to flow state.** |

## The Philosophy: Your Mind is the Kernel

Axorith was born from a simple, powerful observation: **the modern digital workspace is fundamentally broken.**

The very tools meant to help us have become the primary source of friction. Existing applications only treat the symptoms—they are features *within* the chaos.

**Axorith is not another application. It is an opinionated operating environment.** We believe your computer should be a silent, purpose-built instrument for your mind, not a battlefield for your attention.

Our philosophy is built on three core principles:

*   **Lightweight & Efficient:** Axorith is a minimal, native application that respects your system's resources. It's designed to serve your focus, not consume it.
*   **Radical Modularity:** Your workflow is unique. We don't lock you into our way of thinking. The entire system is built on plugins. Axorith provides the conductor's podium; you choose the instruments.
*   **You Are In Control:** Axorith gives you the power to design your ideal environment. It's not about complex settings, but about meaningful control. You define the rules for your focus.

We are building a thin abstraction layer between you and your machine—one designed to serve your flow, not fight it.

## Core Features

*   ⚙️ **Session Presets:** Codify your entire workflow for different tasks (e.g., "Coding," "Writing," "Gaming Mode") into reusable, one-click launchers.
*   🧩 **Radical Modularity:** The entire system is built on plugins. A powerful SDK lets you and the community integrate any tool with an API.
*   🛡️ **Unmatched Stability:** Built with a client-server architecture. If the UI crashes for any reason, your session **keeps running** without interruption.
*   👩‍💻 **Developer First:** A clean, well-documented SDK makes creating and sharing your own modules simple and powerful.

### Tech Stack
*   **.NET 9** & **C# 13**
*   **Avalonia UI** for a true cross-platform native UI on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **ReactiveUI (MVVM)** for a modern, reactive UI architecture.
*   **Serilog** for structured, production-ready logging.

### Architecture
Axorith is built on a clean, modular architecture to ensure stability, testability, and extensibility. You can read the full guide [here](docs/architecture.md).

## Roadmap & Development

Axorith is under active development, moving towards a powerful, stable release. Our vision is ambitious, and our progress is transparent.

*   **Milestone 1: The Perfect Launch (In Progress)**
    *   Bulletproof client-server architecture for maximum stability.
    *   Flawless onboarding and user experience.
    *   A core set of powerful modules (App/Site Blocker, System Focus, Spotify).
    *   Secure authentication provider system.

*   **Milestone 2: The Ecosystem**
    *   Session scheduling, cloud sync for presets, and an in-app module browser.

*   **Milestone 3: The "Productivity OS"**
    *   Deeper integrations, team features, and focus analytics.
